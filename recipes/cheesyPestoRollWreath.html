<ul>
    <li>2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent rolls</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened.</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>½ cup basil pesto, divided</li>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Draw a 5-inch circle on the center of the parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Open both cans of dough and separate crescents into 16 triangles. Arrange the triangles on the prepared baking sheet the flat edges lined up and overlapping along the 5-inch circle and the points facing outward; it will resemble a sunburst.</li>
    <li>Combine cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, and 6 tablespoons pesto in a bowl. Mix until well combined, then spread around the center of the ring of crescent dough.</li>
    <li>Wrap each dough triangle up over filling and tucking it under the bottom to secure. Repeat around the entire ring. Brush remaining 2 tablespoons pesto on top.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the dough is golden brown and cooked, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Slice into individually portioned rings, but keep all the rings in place in the shape of a wreath. Garnish with rosemary sprigs and cherry tomatoes.</li>
